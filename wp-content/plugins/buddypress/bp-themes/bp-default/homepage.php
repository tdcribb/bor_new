								You fit into a bigger context than you probably think.
			
								Our past has created our present.  How we are interconnected with our ancestors, all the way down to our parents, is a 
								fascinating area of study.  But have you ever wondered how all of our ancestors may have been related to each other?
						
								</br></br>	
								We aren't just talking about blood relations, or relations by marriage, but relationships founded on geography, neighborhoods, 
								businesses, travels and travails shared by people of a community.
									</br></br>	
								As a member, you are able to access all of the data in our archives that directly and indirectly relate to you who are. With 
								a better understanding of our past, we can have a tighter grasp on who we may become in the future.
								</br></br>
								This is your opportunity to keep the past alive for generations to come.

								"Thank you, Book of Relations!  
								I can't tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity to retell all these family stories before it's too late!
								My grandchildren will be able to find these and know about their family history, even when I'm not there to tell them.  Thank you!"
