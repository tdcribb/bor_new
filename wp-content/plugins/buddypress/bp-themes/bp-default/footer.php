					</br></br>

					<span class="overlay-subtitles">E-SIGN DISCLOSURE AND CONSENT</span></br>
						This Electronic Disclosure and Consent (“Disclosure”) applies to any privacy or other notices, disclosures, reports, documents, communications, 
						or other records provided by LCDD or a Provider regarding the Online Services (collectively, “Notices”). By assenting to these Terms of Use, 
						you agree that LCDD and Providers (i) may provide you with any Notices that they may choose to send or make available to you, to the extent 
						allowed by law, in electronic form and (ii) that you have been able to read this Disclosure and have access to the software and hardware 
						(described below) necessary to access the Notices.
					</br></br>
						All Notices that LCDD or a Provider elect to provide to you in electronic form will be provided either (i) via e-mail to the address that you 
						provided upon enrollment or (ii) by posting the Notice on the website by which you access the Online Services. The delivery of any Notice is 
						effective when sent, regardless of how it is delivered to you, whether you read the Notice when you receive it, or whether you actually receive 
						the delivery.
					</br></br>
						Consent is a condition to the use of Online Services. If at any time you decide to withdraw your consent, you may do so by canceling or 
						discontinuing your use of the Online Services. Should you subsequently resume use of the Online Services, you will be deemed to have ratified 
						your original consent.
					</br></br>
						LCDD may treat the provision of an invalid e-mail address, or the subsequent malfunction of a previously valid e-mail address, as a withdrawal 
						of your consent to receive Notices in electronic form. LCDD will not impose any fee to process the withdrawal of your consent to receive Notices 
						in electronic form; however, your access to and use of the website and Online Services may be terminated. Any withdrawal of your consent to receive 
						Notices in electronic form will be effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal.
					</br></br>
						In order to access, view, and retain electronic Notices that LCDD makes available to you, you must: (i) have access to an Internet service account, 
						(ii) an e-mail account (and any necessary e-mail software), and (iii) have access to a personal computer, operating system, and telecommunications 
						connections to the Internet capable of receiving, accessing, displaying, and either printing or storing Notices received from LCDD in electronic 
						form via a plain text-formatted e-mail or by access to the website using your Internet browser application (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari).
					</br></br>
						LCDD will not send you a paper copy of a Notice which is available electronically unless you request it, or we otherwise deem it appropriate to do so. 
						You can obtain a paper copy of an electronic Notice by printing it yourself or by requesting that we mail you a paper copy, provided that such request 
						is made within a reasonable time after we first provided the electronic Notice to you. To request a paper copy, call us at 1-800-328-8602. LCDD may 
						charge you a reasonable service charge, of which we will have provided you prior notice, for the delivery of paper copies of any Notice provided to 
						you electronically pursuant to this authorization. LCDD reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to provide a paper (instead of electronic) 
						copy of any Notice that you have authorized us to provide electronically.
					</br></br>
						All Notices in either electronic or paper format from us to you will be considered “in writing.” You should print or download for your records a copy 
						of this Disclosure and any other Notice that is important to you.
					</br></br>
						You acknowledge and agree that your consent to electronic Notices is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce 
						that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and that you and LCDD both intend that the Act apply to the 
						fullest extent possible to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.
					</br></br>
						LCDD reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your electronic Notices, or to terminate or change the terms and 
						conditions on which it provides electronic Notices. LCDD will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.

				How do I become a Publishing Member so I can add my own family posts?</br>
				I have a Publishing Membership, how do I submit my family information to be published on this site?</br>
				How do I find a family tree?</br>
				</br></br>
				<span class="overlay-subtitles">What is a GEDCOM file?</span></br>
					GEDCOM files are a type of document developed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be used
					in genealogical data which can be imported and exported by many different software systems. For a more complete
					explanataion please visit this link: <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM">GEDCOM</a>
					
					If you need a suggested free software system to help you in the creation of your family tree and the GEDCOM file
					needed for importing into this site, we recommend <a target="blank" href="http://gramps-project.org/">Gramps</a>. It can be used on both
					Macs and Windows.</br></br>
					<ul class="bullet-points">
						<li class="bullet-points">Go to gramps-project.org from the link above or copy and past the address in your browser or visit any other software application of your choosing to create your family tree.</li>
						<li class="bullet-points">Follow their instructions on downloading and using their application.</li>
						<li class="bullet-points">Once you have completed your family tree and saved a GEDCOM file to your computer, visit our <a href="/membership-options/add-your-history/">Add Your History</a>
					page to submit your GEDCOM file for us to import using the form on the right entitled "Submit your genealogy to Book of Relations...".</li>
				</ul>
				</br> </br>
				<span class="overlay-subtitles">How do I become a Publishing Member so I can add my own family posts?</span></br>
					If you would like to post your own history, stories, or family trees, visit our
					<a href="/membership-option">Membership Options</a> page to register for our Publishing Membership
					and begin adding your history and stories today.
				</br> </br>
				<span class="overlay-subtitles">I have a Publishing Membership, how do I submit my family information to be published on this site?</span></br>
					Now that you are a Publishing Member of Book of Relations, visit 
					<a href="/membership-options/add-your-history/">Add Your History</a> under the Membership Options menu tab.
					There are two ways in which to submit your family information. You can either submit a story or post via the left form on this page entitled "Write 
					your own chapter in the Book of Relations...". Your Title, Family Names/Events/Places, and Content will be added just as you have 
					entered this information, with our staff only proofreading for grammer and puctuation. Please allow up to 24 hours for these posts to be published. 
					</br></br>
					The second option is to use the second form on the right of the page entitled "Submit your genealogy to Book of Relations...". This form allows you 
					to submit your story or history as well as attach documents you wish to include in your submission. This could include Images, Documents, Digitized 
					Family Books, and Family Trees in which a <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM">GEDCOM</a> file would be required. If information
					is submitted via the second form, it will take up to 48 hours for this to be analyzed, additional information created, and the final publishing
					of the information to be completed. You can utilize these forms as much as you want as long as you are a Publishing Member. 
				</br> </br>
				<span class="overlay-subtitles">How do I find a family tree?</span></br>
					If you know the name of the person or surname (last name) you wish to view, you can perform a search in any of the search fields located in
					Book of Relations or under "Search Family Trees / Surnames" on the right of the page in the sidebar to return a list of family tree pages and 
					stories which include individuals or family names.
