== Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.4.0 ==

1. If you are still running a version earlier than 2.4.0, you must first upgrade to 2.4.0 before going any higher

Usage:

For detailed documentation, goto [ed4becky.net/plugins/RootsPersona] (http://ed4becky.net/plugins/RootsPersona "Documentation")

To import your first GEDCOM and create your first page(s):

1. Find the *Upload GEDCOM File* page link under RootsPersona Options.
2. Browse for a GEDCOM file on your local PC and select 'Upload'.
3. Select one or more persons to create pages for and select 'Submit'

Your WordPress site will now have one or more *persona* pages for the people you selected!

*Note: importing GEDCOM files from different programs can have unexpected consequences.
RootsPersona uses the ids generated in the GEDCOM file, and different programs may assign the same ids to different people.
It is recommended to manage your data in a single program (the 'system of record'),
and to use GEDCOM files generated by that program, only.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happened to the GEDCOM file I uploaded? =

The GEDCOM file on your PC is untouched.  The copy uploaded to WordPress is converted into a set of
person and family files in XML format.  After conversion, the GEDCOM file uploaded to WordPress is deleted.

= I only want people who are logged in to see certain people on my site. =

You can change the default privacy setting on the Options page, or override the setting on a page by page basis.

= When I try to upload a file, the screen goes blank. =

This is usually a timeout issue on your site.  See the explanation on the upload page.

= Can a reload a GEDCOM? =

Yes.  As long as the INDI ids are the same, existing records will be updated, not duplicated.
HOWEVER if your program assigns new ids to the same people, your data may become corrupt, so make sure you check.
You may also delete pages and data using the <i>Tools->rootspersona->Delete Pages</i> and reload the GEDCOM.

Currently you will lose any links to pictures if you do that.

== Screenshots ==

2. Formatted Family Sheets
3. Per page privacy settings and pictures, now integrated with the WordPress Media Picker
4. Variety of tools for managing persona pages
